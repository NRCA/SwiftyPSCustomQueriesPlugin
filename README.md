# SwiftyPSCustomQueriesPlugin
SwiftyPSCustomQueriesPlugin is used, along with [SwiftyPSCustomQueries](https://github.com/NRCA/SwiftyPSCustomQueries), to interact with the PowerSchool API. The plugin does a couple of things:
1. Provides the credentials needed to connect with the PowerSchool API using [SwiftyPSCustomQueries](https://github.com/NRCA/SwiftyPSCustomQueries).
2. Allows you to create custom [PowerQueries](https://support.powerschool.com/developer/#/page/powerqueries), which are SQL statements executed directly on the PowerSchool server.

You can use the plugin as is, or you can modify and add to it as you see fit.

_SwiftyPSCustomQueriesPlugin is not endorsed, sponsored, or affilitated with PowerSchool in any way.
